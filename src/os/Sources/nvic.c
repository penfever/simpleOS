	 * is an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED power of two in the range 8 to 256,
	 * and the minimum supported priority value is always 0.  All priority
	 * value fields are 8-bits, and if an implementation supports fewer
	 * than 256 priority levels then low-order bits of these fields are
	 * RAZ."
	 * 
	 * In the K70 Sub-Family Reference Manual in section "3.2.2.1 Interrupt
	 * priority levels" on page 85 (Rev. 2) or page 87 (Rev. 3 or 4), it
	 * states, "This device supports 16  priority levels for interrupts.
	 * Therefore, in the NVIC each source in the IPR registers contains
	 * 4 bits."  The diagram that follows goes on to confirm that only
	 * the high-order 4 bits of each 8 bit field is used.  It doesn't
	 * explicitly mention the System Handler (like the SVC handler)
	 * priorities, but they should be handled consistently with the
	 * interrupt priorities.
