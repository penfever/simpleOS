/*   
Write a program named word-count.c in C, that uses file
  I/O to read a text file whose name is specified on the command line
  to the program.  
  
  All code for word-count should be placed in a
  src/word-count directory.

Lines are delimited by a newline character
 (or additionally and optionally for development on Windows
   computers, by a carriage-return immediately followed by a linefeed). 

   No other characters should be treated specially (i.e., punctuation,
  hyphens, etc. should just be considered as non-white-space
  characters that should be treated as part of words).

  case sensitive

  Upon reaching
  end-of-file, the program will output to stdout: (1) the number of
  lines in the input file (include blank lines in the count of the
  number of lines), 

  (2) the total number of words in the input file
  (*not* the number of unique words), 

  (3) a list of each unique word
  in the input file along with the number of times that word appears
  in the file.
